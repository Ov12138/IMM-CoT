Used python packages are described in the [requirements file](https://github.com/lwachowiak/Metaphor-Extraction-With-GPT-3/blob/main/requirements.txt). An OpenAI API Key is required. 
- Data for prompting and fine-tuning can be found in the [Data](https://github.com/lwachowiak/Metaphor-Extraction-With-GPT-3/tree/main/Data) folder. The LCC corpus should be requested from the authors of the LCC corpus. 
- Annotations made through GPT-3 can be found in the respective folders for [validation](https://github.com/lwachowiak/Metaphor-Extraction-With-GPT-3/tree/main/Validation%20Results/Source%20Completion) and [test](https://github.com/lwachowiak/Metaphor-Extraction-With-GPT-3/tree/main/Test%20Results/Source%20Completion/Few%20Shot) results. The test data also contains the authors' annotations.
